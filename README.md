## About this repository

This is a special repository used to set defaults for other repositories
within the Emacsmirror.

## Adding new packages to the Emacsmirror

Most packages that are available from [Melpa] are also available from
the Emacsmirror.  New packages are added to Melpa on a regular basis
and after a short delay these packages are also semi-automatically added
to the Emacsmirror.  So there is no need to ask for new Melpa additions
to be added to the Emacsmirror too.  It will happen but it might take a
few days.

To get a new package added to the mirror [add it to Melpa][melpa-add]
instead.  That way Melpa users benefit too.

Some packages, which have been available from Melpa for a long time, are
not available from the Emacsmirror.  See [these lists][not-mirror] and
[these pages](/stats) for the various reasons.
