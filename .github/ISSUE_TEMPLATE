Thanks for your interest in contributing to this package.

This repository is only a mirror.  Please do not open an issue here.  Instead figure out where the upstream repository is and open an issue there.  If the upstream repository is located on Github, then you should see a link "forked from somebody-else/this-project" above, which will take you there.

If you are opening an issue at https://github.com/emacsmirror/.github, then please disregard the above.  It does not apply in that case, but for technical reasons I cannot prevent it from being shown to you anyway.
